# Matching Application

(For all information about the app, see <a href="https://github.com/LinaParren/matching_application/wiki">wiki</a>)


## Concept
My concept is an application that can match you with a cafe. Everyone wants something different from a night at the cafe. Someone wants the small and cozy cafes, someone else can't have enough people around him/her. This app is going to help you to find your ideal cafe.  


## Functies
The user can make his or her own account on this app, on which he/she can save data and look back at it. There are some functions that come within the app:
* The user can make an account
* The user can log in and out on the account
* The user can chance data on the account
* The user can delete the account
